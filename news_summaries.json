    "summary": "On July 14, 2025, Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 Resolver service experienced a global outage for about an hour due to a misconfiguration of legacy systems used to maintain the infrastructure. This misconfiguration led to the inadvertent withdrawal of the 1.1.1.1 Resolver prefixes, causing DNS traffic to drop globally, triggering internal alerts, and necessitating a fix deployment to restore service. Cloudflare is implementing steps to mitigate similar incidents in the future by deprecating legacy systems and improving deployment methodologies for increased stability."
